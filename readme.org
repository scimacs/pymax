#+title: pymax - A python package to install and run pymax
#+date: [2019-08-07 Wed]

You can install the bleeding edge version of this with this command.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install git+git@github.com:scimacs/pymax.git
#+END_SRC

One day you will be able to just do:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install pymax
#+END_SRC

but that won't happen before this is pretty stable. I do not have a timeline for deciding that, it will happen after I have used it myself long enough to be happy with it.
