#+title: pymax - A python package to install and run pymax
#+date: [2019-08-07 Wed]


The best way to try this right now is this installation script:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scimacs/pymax/master/scimax/scripts/install-scimax-win.sh)"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:


* Python

My thought on this package is you would install it as a python package that would include some executable scripts to install and run Python. I am not positive I will stick with that idea though.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install git+git://github.com/scimacs/pymax.git
#+END_SRC

One day you will be able to just do:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install pymax
#+END_SRC

but that won't happen before this is pretty stable. I do not have a timeline for deciding that, it will happen after I have used it myself long enough to be happy with it.
