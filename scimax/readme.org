#+title: Python package to run scimax

The idea in this package is to make it very easy to install scimax from python on all platforms.



* One day in the future

These do not currently work, but might one day.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install scimax
#+END_SRC



Then, there will be a command line utility to install and run scimax. For example, on Windows you would run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
install-scimax-win.sh
#+END_SRC
